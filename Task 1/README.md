**Data Science & Business Analytics Task 1** 

This is the first task in which we use a simple linear regression model to predict the percentage that the student will get based on the hour he/she has studied.
It uses the scikit learn module of python to train the model and predict the output.
It also uses seaborn and matplotlib for data analysis.
